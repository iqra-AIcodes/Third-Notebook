Day 4 Python Notes

Task 1: Simple Calculator
Purpose: Take two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) and print the result.
Key Concepts: input(), int(), if-elif-else.

Example:
Input: 10, 5, *
Output: 50

Tips & Tricks:
Always convert input to numbers using int()
Make sure to compare operations as text: "+" not +
Mistakes to Avoid:
Forgetting quotes around +, -, *, /
Forgetting else condition for invalid input

Task 2: Guessing Game
Purpose: User guesses a secret number; program tells if it’s correct, too high, or too low
Key Concepts: Conditions (if, elif, else), int().

Example:
Secret: 7, User guesses: 10 → Output: "Too high!"

Tips & Tricks:
Always convert input to number using int()
Use elif for multiple conditions
Mistakes to Avoid:
Using = instead of ==
Forgetting else for numbers smaller than secret

Task 3: Even-Odd Counter
Purpose: Count how many numbers are even or odd and optionally show them.
Key Concepts: Loops (for), modulo %, lists, len().

Example:
Input numbers: 1, 2, 8 → Output: Even: 2 [2,8], Odd: 1 [1]

Tips & Tricks:
Initialize counters or lists before the loop
Keep print statements outside the loop
Use %2 to check even/odd
Mistakes to Avoid:
Resetting counters inside the loop
Printing inside the loop by mistake

Task 4: Simple Function
Purpose: Create reusable code to greet someone by name.
Key Concepts: def (function), parameters, reusable code, calling function multiple times.

Example:
Function: welcome(name) → welcome("Ali") → "Hello Ali, welcome to Python!"

Tips & Tricks:
Functions reduce repeated code
You can take input from the user to make it interactive
Mistakes to Avoid:
Forgetting to define parameter in function
Forgetting to call the function after defining
General Tips 
Always test your code with multiple inputs
Use comments in code to explain your steps
Check indentation carefully — Python is strict about it
Small programs like these build logic and problem-solving skills
